# Abstract

This research uses Google Trends and Voyant tools to analyze online data to identify the most popular sports in the world. We determine the elements affecting each sport's popularity by looking at search trends and social media activity connected to sports.

# Introduction

A big part of how culture and society are shaped around the globe is through sports. This research aims to determine the most well-liked sports worldwide, despite the possibility that some sports genres are more well-liked locales. Even though earlier studies looked at the use of digital tools for sports data analysis, more study is still required to fully comprehend sports fans' tastes and pinpoint opportunities for the sports industry to expand.

To fill this gap, this research uses Google Trends and Voyant tools to investigate the global appeal of various sports categories. With the aid of Voyant tools, we analyze texts and extract data to determine the most widely watched sports categories. In the meantime, we keep an eye on sports genres' appeal and follow changes over time using Google Trends.

Wendy Hui Kyong Chun, Richard Grusin, Patrick Jagoda, and Rita Raley discuss the potential drawbacks of digital humanities in their article "The Dark Side of the Digital Humanities," including the danger of reducing complex human experiences to data points and the potential for technology to exacerbate societal biases. The authors contend that it is crucial to critically evaluate the function of digital tools in humanities study and consider the broader social and cultural ramifications of their use. While digital technologies can aid in developing novel research methods and offer insightful information, they also have drawbacks and should be utilized cautiously. The authors stress the significance of retaining a critical viewpoint and being aware of the potential repercussions of relying excessively on digital tools.

In "Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display," Johanna Drucker examines the use of visual analysis in humanities research. Drucker's method can help explain the findings of this study on determining the most popular sports in the world utilizing online resources like Google Trends and Voyant. The study aims to identify the sports with the most significant worldwide appeal and the variables influencing that appeal. The study can identify the most popular sports categories globally by analyzing social media activity and search trends using digital methods. The results can serve as a roadmap for stakeholders in the sports sector as they make data-driven decisions to improve their products and better serve their target consumers. The technique taken by Drucker emphasizes the importance of visual representation in presenting complex data and can help make the research's conclusions more approachable.

# Methodology

The goal of our research will be to spot patterns and trends in people's global sports preferences. We will use statistical tools to analyze the data and determine the factors influencing sports appeal. These factors may include cultural and social factors, such as how easily people can access sporting facilities and how well-liked certain sports are among various age groups.

Our overall goal is to offer information about the sports genres that are most popular around the globe and the elements that influence those genres' appeal. This data can support initiatives aimed at enticing sports fans worldwide, such as marketing plans, programming choices, etc.

## Note:

Stephen Ramsay and Geoffrey Rockwell's reading "Developing Things: Notes toward an Epistemology of Building in the Digital Humanities" helps our argument as it explains digital technologies can help create new research methodologies and provide informative data that have downsides and should only be used with prudence. The authors emphasize the value of maintaining a critical mindset and being aware of the risks associated with relying too much on digital tools.

## Processing and Tool Use

Sports-related texts from different sources, such as news articles, social media posts, and sports blogs, will be analyzed using Voyant tools. This will enable us to compile data on the sports categories that are most popular globally. We'll also use Google Trends to pinpoint the most well-liked sports categories, track popularity changes over the last five years, and finally, use RAW Graphs to make a chart of it.


# Results

According to our research, in the last five years, Basketball has been the most searched sport in the world, according to a study of the digital data collected using Google Trends. 

Soccer is the second most searched sport on the list, which can be attributed to the numerous names that the sport is known by around the world. It was discovered to be the most used term in articles, sports news, and Twitter after further analysis using Voyant. I confirmed that the word "football" in this sentence pertains to soccer. 

American football, the most popular activity in North America, is the third most searched sport worldwide. The fourth most searched activity worldwide is ice hockey, which has a sizable following in North America, Europe, and Russia. 

Lastly, cricket receives the fewest searches out of the five sports groups examined. South Asia, Australia, and the United Kingdom, where it is regarded as a national activity, all have sizable fan bases.
